I'm creating a game about neoliberalism. It will be a cross between Monopoly, Civilisation and Plague Inc.

The game-play:
Each turn, a user can complete a few actions. The actions are:

TURN, RESEARCH, INVEST, ACQUIRE, EXPAND, MARKETING, DONATE, PAY_FINE, BRIBE, ASSASSINATION, LOBBY, GO_PUBLIC

Each action's results contributes, positively or negatively (depending on the action result), to a change in the game's score_factor.

The higher the score_factor, the faster the player gains points / influence / power / money but also the faster the nations and other players fight back against you.

A central part of the game is the technology tree: there are dozens of technologies to unlock and attain and each will bring both pros and cons. To keep this simple, each tech will, when unlocked and equipped*, affect a calculation that will affect the score_factor. The score_factor goes from 0 to 2, with 1 representing no growth, no shrinkage.

These factors are:

CAPITAL, CASH, RESEARCH, INFLUENCE, EMISSIONS, PUBLIC_OPINION, ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT - each from +5 to -5

For example, unlocking and equipping 3D Printing could looking something like:

`{ CAPITAL: 3, CASH: 3, RESEARCH: 3, INFLUENCE: 3, EMISSIONS: 3, PUBLIC OPINION: 3, PRODUCTIVITY: 3, ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT: 3 }`

Each tech has a short description about what it does and how it affects the game.

The game's progress spans 10 periods of company growth. These are:

MICRO, SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, NATIONAL, GLOBAL, DOMINANT, TOP_100, TOP_10, MONOPOLY

with the beginner tech at the start and the final, complete tech at the end

Each tech, with the exception of those in MICRO, depends on one or more tech being unlocked and equipped before it. Inversely, tech in the final stage have no successor; they are the final result.

A tech has 6 phases:

LOCKED, UNLOCKED, ENABLED, EQUIPPED, SOLD and PURCHASED. PURCHASED and ENABLED or PURCHASED and ENABLED are the only combinations that can both be true at the same time.

Each tech belongs to a category:

ADVANCED_COMPUTING, BIOTECHNOLOGY, ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, FINANCIAL_TECHNOLOGIES, INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES, LOGISTICS_AND_MARKETING, MANUFACTURING_AND_MATERIALS, MISCELLANEOUS, TRANSPORTATION_TECHNOLOGIES, VIRTUAL_AND_AUGMENTED_REALITY

Each tech is versioned between v2 and v4. Some tech has two versions, some three and some four. The versions should be spread out between company growth.

In summary, progress is determined by technology. Each tech has quantitative pros and cons when EQUIPPED. Tech can be bought and sold. Tech is unlocked in accordance with company size and growth. Tech is versioned and belongs to a category.

Create a spreadsheet (CSV) with the following columns:

Category, Technology, Version, Company Size, Unlocked by, Unlocks, Unlocks Version, Description, Equipped Factor

eg

ADVANCED_COMPUTING, AI, 1, MEDIUM, "Machine Learning, Graphics Cards", Robotics V2, Lorem ipsum, "{ CAPITAL: 3, CASH: 3, RESEARCH: 3, INFLUENCE: 3, EMISSIONS: 3, PUBLIC OPINION: 3, PRODUCTIVITY: 3, ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT: 3 }"

The format should be CSV and copyable!!

There should be 60 tech minimum. The technologies should span all 10 company sizes with an average of 6 per company size.

*A player can sell their tech to the highest bidder or use it as part or all of a trade.

Climate-cleaning technologies are the most important, but a player shouldn't realize this until its too late. And if they adopt it early, they lose. It's a lose-lose situation because the system is broken.
