# Ideas

## I need an idea, but I think I need to go through previous ideas and asses why they didn't go anywhere

- Lywe
  - Wasn't super knowledgeable about the tech
  - Put the cart before the horse, building a UI library and not a product
  - Wasn't as good with tech then as I am now; I saw it as an educational side hobby, not a product
- Manyanaponics
  - Didn't really know what I was working towards. I had a mostly constructed idea but it wouldn't be marketable
  - Again, more of a learning curve
  - Tech kept changing (DB, backend, frontend, style etc)
- Manyana UN goals
  - Test project to learn more about Next14, Turbo, Vercel DB
  - Never really intended to be anything marketable

So in summary:
- all projects have been for learning tech
- the most thought-through app (Manyanaponics) wasn't marketable and needed a proper app. 
- the idea needs to be good and thought-through. Then planned from both ends

Ideas
- Health
  - exercise app built for me, so weights, cycling and yoga
  - gamification (like DuoLingo) would be great
  - Import / Excel
  - add stats like height, weight, BMI, body fat % etc, either manually or by integration
- Wealth
  - Obviously not a bank, but with banking app integrations
  - Localised tax advice and resources on how to build wealth
  - Charts and views to show how a user's wealth would grow with different strategies
- Games
  - Neoliberal
    - Like Plague Inc but with libertarians
    - Show it like a virus that you have to spread to every country
    - If you win, the world dies
    - Victory progress has things like pollution, climate change, corporation control v state control, innovation, deaths
    - Random things like pandemics, unrest, resource wars, assassinations, famine, sea level rise, storms etc all have an impact
    - Famous neo-liberals make appearances (Margaret Thatcher, Keynes, Malthus etc)
