# NeoLiberal: The Game

This game is like Plague Inc but with neoliberalism as the plague

- Either turn-based (Civ) or continuous (Plague Inc)
  - 1 turn = 1 week
  - 1 second = 1 day
- You choose the country in which to start your business
- You can choose to compete with other companies (eg Civ) or by yourself (Plague Inc)
- You start with some money and a small amount of profit every week
- You choose what to do with the money
  - Starts with just 'reinvest' to grow but eventually unlocks other options:
    - bribe (health & safety officials)
    - lobby (to reduce regulation)
    - assassinate (whistleblowers)
    - corporate army (banana republic)
    - r&d (to create new products)
    - donate to campaigns (puppets)
    - union-busting / repress human rights
    - expand abroad
      - this is the most desired step, but you don't just need money
        - each country is different; some will let you expand, some will require concessions, others are outright hostile
        - You can send representatives to countries that build influence by schmoozing
        - Other countries might have resources you want / need. Bring them into the fold by a mix of investment, bribes, coercion (private army) and allies
- The score system
